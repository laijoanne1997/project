Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a Database file. The user should be able to:

Add, Update, and Delete tasks
Mark a task as in progress or done
List all tasks
List all tasks that are done
List all tasks that are not done
List all tasks that are in progress
Here are some constraints to guide the implementation:

You can use any programming language to build this project.
Use positional arguments in command line to accept user inputs.
Use a Database file to store the tasks in the current directory.
The Database file should be created if it does not exist.
Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the Database file.
Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to build this project.
Ensure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
Example
The list of commands and their usage is given below:

# Adding a new task
python3 task_tracker.py add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)

# Updating and deleting tasks
python3 task_tracker.py update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
python3 task_tracker.py delete 1

# Marking a task as in progress or done
python3 task_tracker.py mark-in-progress 1
python3 task_tracker.py mark-done 1

# Listing all tasks
python3 task_tracker.py list

# Listing tasks by status
python3 task_tracker.py list done
python3 task_tracker.py list todo
python3 task_tracker.py list in-progress
Task Properties
Each task should have the following properties:

description: A short description of the task
status: The status of the task (todo, in-progress, done)
createdAt: The date and time when the task was created
updatedAt: The date and time when the task was last updated
Make sure to add these properties to the Database file when adding a new task and update them when updating a task.

Happy coding!
